# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Fictional investment bank, Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients; however, the company needs assistance in determining which cryptocurrencies they should offer.  Senior management has requested a report that include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and if they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data from Accountability Accounting needed to be cleaned in order to fit the machine learning models, and since there isn't a known output for what this investment bank is looking for, unsupervised machine learning was employed.  In order to group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was utilized and the data was visualized so the finding could be shared with the board.
